## Overview

The **GitHub Team Visualizer** is a React-based web application designed to provide a clear, visual overview of activity and collaboration in public GitHub repositories. It helps developers, team leads, and project managers quickly understand team productivity, code review processes, and project milestones.  

This makes the app a must for developers and managers, as it not only provides a quick overview of team performance but also surfaces potential bottlenecks and collaboration issues that might otherwise go unnoticed in GitHub’s default interface.
